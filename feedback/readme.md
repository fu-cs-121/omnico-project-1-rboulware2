# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Royton Boulware

### Python Script Functionality

- Your `main.py` script successfully opens the CSV file, reads in the data, converts the session duration and happiness rating values to integers, and correctly aggregates the totals for each algorithm.
- The averages for happiness and session duration are calculated as specified, and you correctly identify the algorithm with the highest average happiness rating as well as the one with the longest average session duration.
- The final printed output closely matches the provided sample output, demonstrating that you met the functional requirements of the assignment.

### Report Content

- Your `report.md` is structured with clear sections for the introduction, methodology, results, observations, and conclusions.
- You explained your approach to reading the CSV file, performing the calculations, and determining the key statistics. The report details your reasoning in a way that aligns well with the assignment objectives.
- The results section clearly lists the calculated values and identifies the top-performing algorithms, which effectively communicates your analysis.

### Overall Implementation & Commit History

- The commit messages indicate a clear progression in your work, with a commit that marks both the completion of the `main.py` project portion and the analysis report.
- Your work is organized and meets all the requirements stated in the project instructions.
